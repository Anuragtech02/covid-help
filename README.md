# Covid Help

>A platform that brings Patients and their Families together.

## Abstract

The Covid-19 pandemic wreaked havoc on hospital management, resulting in miscommunication and misinformation about patients' health information passed on to their families.\
***Covid-Help*** is an excellent solution to this issue. Our app will inform family members about their loved ones' health status, which will be updated by doctors or nurses via a QR-code.


## Basis Description

- As soon as patient is alloted a bed in Hospital, the respective person-in-charge must register the patient to this app through Web App of Covid-Help.
- After registration, a QR code will be generated that must be attached to the bed of the patient.
- The person-in-charge now can just scan the QR code and fill patient's information such as:

    >Blood Pressure\
    >Pulse Rate\
    >SpO2\
    >Temperature
- Doctors can now assess their patient through via Covid-Help Dashboard and update the information in real-time.
